2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

Latency: < 5 seconds for live data updates.

Accuracy: â‰¥ 95% precision in sentiment analysis.

Scalability: Handle 10,000+ concurrent users.

3. System Architecture
3.1 Workflow

Data Ingestion:
python

# Fetch NSE data

from nsepy import get_history
data = get_history(symbol="RELIANCE", start=date(2024,1,1), end=date.today())

Technical Analysis:
python
# Calculate RSI

import talib
data['RSI'] = talib.RSI(data['Close'], timeperiod=14)

News Sentiment:
python

from textblob import TextBlob
sentiment = TextBlob(news_headline).sentiment.polarity

Alerts:
python

if data['Volume'] > 1.5 * data['Volume'].mean():  
    send_sms("High Volume Alert: RELIANCE")  

3.2 Tech Stack

Backend: Python (FastAPI/Django)
